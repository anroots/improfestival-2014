                <h2>About Tilt</h2>

<p>In the spring of 2013 Improgrupp Jaa! came back from FIIF (<a href="http://finlandimprovfestival.com">Finland International Improv Festival</a>) almost in euphoria. Five days of artistic thrill that had been created by different improv theatres from all over the world, meetings with like-minded people, new friends and discussions that lasted until the sunrise had done its job. We understood that we needed to create for Estonians something that could give similar kind of thrill and experience. And so we had the idea to bring to life the first Estonian international improv festival „Tilt“.</p>
<p>Organizing a festival was an adventure itself and full of tilts (tilt — an unexpected turn in the language of improv). But finally the 17th of October &#8211; the first day of the festival arrived. Altogether there were on the stage three troupes from Estonia: Eesti Improteater, Improkraatia and Improgrupp Jaa! and four troupes from abroad: Clark &amp; Addison (Finland), Rīgas Improvizācijas Teātris (Latvia), Det Andre Teatret (Norway) and Katy &amp; Maria (England). There were all in all about 500 people who were brought together by this festival and many from the audience saw improv for the first time. We were most happy to see that we really managed to share some improv magic and fun around. And so we understood that this can’t be a one-time event.</p>
<p>This year the improv festival Tilt will take place from 6.—8th November in Tallinn, cafe Sinilind. We expect the festival to be filled with smashing and clever improvisers both from Estonia and abroad. We will also offer workshops for people with different improv knowledge and discussions over how to introduce improv in different cultures. And most of all, we will offer days filled with a lot of theatre magic in the autumnal Tallinn.</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We really enjoyed the atmosphere at Tilt &#8211; everyone was so welcoming and warm :) The show programme was a nice mix of different kinds of groups, formats and energy levels. The hostel was lovely and very conveniently located to the show venue and one of the workshop spaces. So thanks for making that happen!&#8221;</p>

„So in turn, I want to thank the crew at the Tallinn International Improv Festival for a wonderful experience. I still can’t believe it happened. I’ve met so many fantastic people in the last week and got a chance to see some stellar Improv. There were some of you who didn’t even have a clue about what is/where is Estonia (actually&#8230;let&#8217;s be honest here&#8230;a bunch of you), but man, it’s amazing. Tallinn is amazing. If you get a chance, go visit. American improvisors, submit to this festival. Please. Do. It. It’s not every day you get to perform in another country. I&#8217;m almost hesitant to even say that because I want Tallinn all to myself, but really, submit. GO. You’ll have so much fun.“

                <blockquote><p>Laughter is liberating.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Meanwhile&#8221; combines the free-flowing feel of long-form with the fast pace and frequent audience suggestions of short-form games. It is a series of scenes punctuated with the word &#8220;meanwhile&#8221; soliciting the audience for a new setting for the next scene. Running at 25 minutes &#8220;Meanwhile&#8221; is a thrill ride that keeps the audience engaged by placing them in the director&#8217;s seat of the action.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ruutu10 unites 10 people from different walks of life who have in common one dream: to do improv at a professional level. Founded in 2013 (and named then Improkraatia) they&#8217;ve built up a loyal fan base by performing regular shows in Tallinn and Tartu. They also teach improv classes and travel throughout Estonia performing and teaching improv-related workshops.</p>
<p>Their desire to constantly hone their skills has driven them to learn from instructors outside of Estonia and many of them have trained at the prestigious iO Theater in Chicago.</p>
<p>They perform both long-form and short-form improvisational shows, always driven by their creed: laughter is liberating.</p>

                <blockquote><p>Animal instincts + human nature = a juicy set-up for drama and comedy!</p></blockquote>
<p>What would an anaconda think of a polar bear if they ever met? What happens when a butterfly falls in love?</p>
<p>According to the ancient legends, we each have an animal spirit inside of us. What if these animal characters started showing through in our everyday lives and relationships? IMP improvises stories about people who are just like you and me &#8211; except that, under the surface, they&#8217;re more than just human&#8230;</p>
<hr />
<p>The four stunning Finnish girls, who, by the way, are part of the only Swedish-speaking, non-professional improv team in Finland, bring you an amazing spectacle run on girl power from over the sea. They have improvised together for over two years and love impro. IMP is specialising in long-form drama, experimenting with different styles and techniques. At Tilt they situate their protagonists based on animal characteristics in human conditions and problems. Come and see how it all works out!</p>

<p>Anne &amp; Frank take your one word suggestion and use the ideas it inspires in them to create a series of base realities from which to develop and explore worlds before organically discovering how these worlds and ideas combine in a unique and unexpected climax. It&#8217;ll be fast-paced, slow-paced and varying other paces at varying other points. You&#8217;ll laugh. You may cry, but that&#8217;s less likely. There&#8217;s a possibility for anger, we&#8217;ll have to see. Oh, and boredom. Just kidding, there&#8217;ll be none of that.</p>
<hr />
<p>International improv troupe C3467X took the loudest member of the team plus the guy who never speaks and made them into two-person improv powerhouse Anne &amp; Frank. Anne &amp; Frank regularly perform all over their home city of London and are known for their two-person Harolds and Monoscenes. 2014 has also seen them perform in New York City at the Del Close Marathon, at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and the Finland International Improv Festival.</p>
<p>Anne &amp; Frank, also known as Carleen Macdermid and Shem Pennant, are both hugely flattered and excited to be performing at the Second Improv Festival Tilt.</p>

<p>One woman. One stage. One emotion that is common to all of us.</p>
<p>Or at least we have a friend to whom something like that has happened and it was so bad, you know&#8230;</p>
<p>Or a friend of a friend&#8230;</p>
<p>You know&#8230;</p>
<p>Join Senja on an unexpected journey towards an inevitable disaster &#8211; and enjoy the ride!</p>
<hr />
<p>Senja Meriläinen is an improviser with a big mouth and an even bigger heart.</p>
<p>She started improvising in 2003 in a young, eager and wild troupe somewhere in the deep forests of northern Finland.</p>
<p>Since those times she&#8217;s received her training at the Loose Moose Theatre in Calgary, Canada and the IO theatre in Chicago, USA &#8211; and on many stages big and small.</p>
<p>In her work she&#8217;s combining different approaches and philosophies to reach the ultimate goal of being a funny, sensitive, dramatic, good-hearted stubborn lovable jerk &#8211; on stage and off.</p>
<p>You can see her perform in Finland with JadaJada Improv, Tampereen Improvisaatioteatteri Snorkkeli &#8211; and in your town if you invite her.</p>

                <blockquote><p>Every city has its stereotypes: what about yours?</p></blockquote>
<p>One stage, three actors, three stories.</p>
<p>In the sometimes provocative show each character is the protagonist of one story. Each character is a stereotype of the city they are playing in. On the stage of Tilt you are presented with stereotypical people of Tallinn.</p>
<p>The three stories are spoken in three different languages: one is in italian, one in english and one in the language of the country that hosts us (in Tallinn it will be almost silent&#8230;)</p>
<hr />
<p>Teatribù is the biggest and longest running improv company in Milano (1991), which has a large improv school and more than 150 people between students, amateurs and professionals. They have attended many improv festivals such as Chicago, Würzburg, Atlanta, Edmonton, Seattle, Tampere, Berlin.</p>
<p>As italians they love to work on body language and mimic. In Italy they talk with hands!</p>

                <blockquote><p>Two chairs, two performers and one word.</p></blockquote>
<p>The production of &#8216;Garwood and Keates&#8217; is an hour show that explores people.</p>
<p>Garwood and Keates set out to base their characters in reality, the intricate nuances, the varied rhythms and the relationships. It is strongly focused on relationships. They create an array of characters, relationships and stories in front of your eyes to pleasure and humour the watchers.</p>
<p>This mindful and slow-paced theatrical experience churns some reality and coaxes honesty. It seeks longer scenes over quick laughs and short scenes. As actors they wish to meet their creations and stay with them until they think they don&#8217;t need them anymore.</p>
<hr />
<p>Two actors that found improvising better. Two strong individuals that came to combine their desires in improv, which aligned without even knowing the prior knowledge.</p>
<p>Nathan Keates is a teacher that has been running workshops for people all around the world and performed in cities like USA; Belgium; Turkey; Germany; UK and many more.</p>
<p>Lindsey Garwood is a wonderful improviser that has been performing for a long time and initiated a new community in Cambridge, UK.</p>
<p>Their focus is to explore and discover. Together, they do various shows and work on their professional improvisation.</p>
<p><strong>NB! Due to unexpected happenings (or as improvisers would say &#8211; tilts), Lindsey Garwood will not be able to make it to Estonia this time. Her place will be taken instead by a very multitalented improviser Rama Nicholas from Australia! You can find out more about her on this page under section workshops.</strong></p>

                <blockquote><p>The power of imagination!</p></blockquote>
<p>A long-form show where four actors form a complete narrative.</p>
<p>The story takes off as the four meet each other and we learn about their characters&#8217; relationships. At first one improviser is chosen and lets the audience dress him/her up. This gives us the lead for our story. Who is he/she? Why is he/she dressed like this? What makes him/her happy? Who are the people around him/her? What crazy adventures and touching scenes does he/she takes us to – these (and more) are the questions improvisers try to answer as they go along with the story and discover the unknown.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Imperium Improv Theatre was formed in 2014. However, the group itself goes back a long way and has improvised together since 2009, when first met as part of the first professional improv group in Estonia.</p>
<p>They perform both long-form and short-form improv, do corporate gigs, organise workshops, perform at private shows at different events and venues: as long as it’s improv – they love it!</p>
<p>As improv is rather new to Estonia, Imperium considers it to be their mission to introduce this exciting form of theatre in their neck of the woods. They enjoy performing improv and watching it conquer the hearts of the audience!</p>
<p>All the members in their group are professional actors. In addition to Imperium they work as freelancers in different theatre, television and movie projects. Some of them are involved in drama troupes of Estonian theatres. The improv troupe also includes three talented musicians and two amazing theatre lighting designers, who help on the mission to spread the love for improv in Estonia.</p>

<p>„Murder mystery“ is a long form show that brings to the audience many interesting and somewhat suspicious characters.</p>
<p>As it is common to murder mysteries, the lives of these people will intertwine and eventually it gets to a point when someone gets murdered. Who is who? Who is the poor victim and who is the murderer? This is up to the audience to decide!</p>
<hr />
<p>JOO! has been together for 15 years. By devoting to the group and performing well together they hope to stay together for some 50 years more! As improv groups tend to be, they are a family of different people sharing love for improv and for each other. JOO! has done a lot of musical improv and will keep doing that also in the future. They are one of a kind and proud of it!</p>

                <h4>At the Movies</h4>
                
                <blockquote><p>Your favorite movies the way we remember them!</p></blockquote>
<p>Based on the plot description of a movie provided by an audience member, Adam and Emily turn that chosen film into a vaguely remembered improvised show.</p>
<p>Weaving in and out of scenes and playing a variety of characters, Adam and Emily provide the audience with a crazy cinematic experience&#8230;on the stage!</p>
<hr />
<p>Adam and Emily are two veteran improvisors from New York City that have been working together as a comedy team since 2007. They first met in an improv 101 class at the Upright Citizens Brigade and have been inseparable ever since. Much like Nicholas &amp; May and Burns &amp; Allen, Adam &amp; Emily bring that old school comedy style with a dash hip and hilarious weirdness.</p>
<p>Adam Taylor started improvising in 2005 in order to get over a bad breakup. He began studying simultaneously at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and the Magnet Theater where many prominent teachers worked through his many problems.</p>
<p>Emily Bryan is a New York based comedian, photographer, and burlesque performer. As a comedian, she has been performing stand up, sketch, and improv for over ten years in Dublin, Boston, and New York. She has written for and performed in over a hundred shows.</p>

The improvisers invest in their characters, each other and the location, creating a grounded, relationship based scene, which they can then use as a jumping off point to investigate the fun and humour to be found in this world, and only this world, which they have created. With no sweeps or tag outs to save you it&#8217;s longform improv without the safety net.</p>
<p>Meant for &#8211; improvisers with stage experience.</p>

                <p>A deep experience of listening, connection and playfulness.</p>
<p>Two years ago, after 10 years of improv theater, I had the chance to meet vocal improvisation; it was an experience of pure joy and energy, and soon I fell in love with this art form. I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m cheating my love (improv theater), actually I do feel like having found a new side of the soul of the love of my life! Because vocal improv is made of listening, connection and making your partner look good. And it&#8217;s made of joy and play! I also may definitely say that vocal improv is making me a better and humbler improvisor. In this workshop I will propose a taste of the work I&#8217;m still doing with Oskar Boldre, a disciple of Bobby McFerrin.<br />
Exercices and games of group listening, feeling free, singing together like a vocal jazz band and singing in duo as two bodies in resonance.<br />
Then we&#8217;ll play improv scenes inspired by our work.</p>
<p>Meant for &#8211; everybody!</p>
<hr />
<p>Fabio Maccioni is an improviser from Milan and been part of Teatribù since 2003. He is honored to have become a teacher in 2008. Since then he has taught impro magic in Italy but as well in France, Switzerland, Germany, and during international festivals (Nancy, Strasbourg, Geneva, Würzburg).</p>
<p>He has studied improv in Milan (and keeps on studying!), in Spain (Valencia), in Seattle (with Randy Dixon), in Edmonton and recently he graduated from iO-Chicago (2014 Summer Intensive).<br />
He likes commedia dell&#8217;arte, he likes physical theater, he likes clown. He dances. He sings. And these art forms are very enriching for him as an improviser.</p>

                <p>Emotions live in our bodies. We carry them with us in the way we stand, walk, breathe and talk.</p>
<p>In &#8220;Feel it&#8221; we will take emotion in improvisation to the basic physical level, which will help you maintain a good kind of tension with your partners on stage, make your characters more alive and more interesting both to the audience and you, and actually will make improvising a lot easier!</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s a fun, witty scene you want to create or the dramatic moment that everybody in the audience will remember for the rest of their lives, taking it to the level of physical reactions will give you new tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feel it&#8221; is a good place to be, whether you have a lot or very little experience in improvisation, since we&#8217;ll all face challenges of our own during the work &#8211; and feel good.</p>
<p>Meant for &#8211; everybody!</p>
<hr />
<p>Senja is an improviser with a big mouth and an even bigger heart.</p>
<p>She started improvising in 2003 in a young, eager and wild troupe somewhere in the deep forests of northern Finland. Since those times she&#8217;s received her training at the Loose Moose Theatre in Calgary, Canada and the IO theatre in Chicago, USA &#8211; and on many stages big and small.</p>
<p>In her work she&#8217;s combining different approaches and philosophies to reach the ultimate goal of being a funny, sensitive, dramatic, good-hearted stubborn lovable jerk &#8211; on stage and off.<br />
As a teacher she is very sensitive when needed, but charge a massive energy load to my groups when needed.</p>

<p>I created this workshop because I felt like there was a need for the exploration of this work after seeing so many scenes wimped out on when it came to performer commitment to love scene. The workshop is designed to help improvisers explore their fears around intimacy on stage, practice their acting skills when it comes to love scene’s, build trust and break down barriers with an ensemble and impro partners. I ask improvisers to share their fears around performing intimate scenes and I challenge them to separate themselves from their character to be able to fulfil their characters journey.</p>
<p>Performing love scenes is a skill like any other that can be learned, it just takes trust, bravery, honesty, a willingness to be vulnerable and a willingness to take risks that perhaps you have never taken before.</p>
<p>Meant for &#8211; improvisers with stage experience.</p>

                <p>Through movies, television and books, we&#8217;ve all had a lot of exposure to genres. Often we know more than we think, and as a group we usually know more than enough. This workshop not only explores the genres that you find difficult but also shows that genres are not something to be scared of, but to be embraced as a method of creating scenes and stories that are in a world that is instantly recognisable to the audience. Never again be stumped by the smart-arse in the audience calling out something he’s never seen himself.</p>
<p>Level of difficulty &#8211; for everybody!</p>
